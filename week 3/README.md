## Inputs, Proceses, Outputs Discussion:
In the afternoon we broke out into groups and went through a list of INPUTS and OUTPUTS in order to try and think of processes which could take the INPUT to the desired OUTPUT. This exercise lead to a lot of interesting and at times crazy discussion about potentials but overall was great in helping get us in a creative and functional thinking mindset.
