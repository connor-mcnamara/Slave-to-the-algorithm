# Week 3

## Summary:
In this session we looked at some work from artists within the realm of rules based design, along with some great example of Non-Human design and drawing machines which lead us into our hands on activity of creating a Non-Human drawing machine of our own with items around our houses. In the afternoon we broke out into groups and completely a INPUTS, PROCESSES & OUTPUTS activity which focused on discissing potetial processes. 

## Non-Human Drawing Machine:
The exercise began with sketching ideas for potential drawing machines that we could make utilising objects around our house, my sketch consisted of a makrer tapeed to a bike tyre, the concept was that when the ture was spun on the the floor in would autonomusly draw on a piece of paper postioned udnerneath.

## Inputs, Proceses, Outputs Discussion:
In the afternoon we broke out into groups and went through a list of INPUTS and OUTPUTS in order to try and think of processes which could take the INPUT to the desired OUTPUT. This exercise lead to a lot of interesting and at times crazy discussion about potentials but overall was great in helping get us in a creative and functional thinking mindset.
