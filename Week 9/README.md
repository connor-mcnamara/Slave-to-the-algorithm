# Week 9

### Summary:
This week we started off by having a Milestone Review which has another opportunity for us all to show where we are currently up too. While the sketch which I presented is still in the very early stages of development I am confident now that I am starting to find my feet a bit more. I am beginning to feel as though I've found a bit my clarity to not only what I am doing with my project but also with my knowledge and understanding of p5.js. I am starting to get the hang of things p5.js finding simple functions a lot easier which is making quite exciting to see how far I can push this project.

### p5.js Workshop:
In this week's workshop we looked in added multiple canvas' to a sketch. This is something that could potentially be useful within my project.
