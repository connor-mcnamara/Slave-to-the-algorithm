# Week 9

### Summary:
This week we started off by having a Milestone Review which has another opportunity for us all to show where we are currently up too. While the sketch which I presented is still in the very early stages of development I am confident now that I am starting to find my feet a bit more. I am beginning to feel as though I've found a bit my clarity to not only what I am doing with my project but also with my knowledge and understanding of p5.js. I am starting to get the hang of things p5.js finding simple functions a lot easier which is making quite exciting to see how far I can push this project.

### p5.js Workshop:
In this week's workshop we looked in added multiple canvas' to a sketch. This is something that could potentially be useful within my project.

### Project Progress:
Currently with in my P5.js sketch I have managed to load a song and have the beat/volume of the song determine the shape of the Cube whist it rotates. Going forward, my next big steps will be focused around incorporating user interaction into the sketch and adding an interface to the environment. In order to incorporate more user interactions I plan start investigating and exploring integrating ML5.js PoseNet in my sketch to allow user facial and arm movements have an impact on how the visualiser moves. I would also like to incorporate a mouse or keyboard driven function which has an effect to either the shape or colour of the visualiser.
