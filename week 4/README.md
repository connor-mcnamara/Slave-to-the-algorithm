# Week 4 

## Summary:
During this weeks class we continued to explore different possibilities within processing expanding our skills in the specific areas of playing with type and images and some of the interactions that we can create with these. Playing around with different functions such as the 'random function and 'pointillism' sketch really helped open my eyes to the possibilites that could come from coding, I knew code was a powerful tool, but actually playing around with different functions really helped spark my thought process in relation to the possibilites of my genrative outcome. 

## Processing Hunting and Gathering exmaple:
While exporing (https://www.openprocessing.org/sketch/889053 "OpenProcessing") there where many cool sketches which I stumbled across, al ot of them being quite mesmorising.
