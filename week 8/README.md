# Week 8 

### Summary:

The class started by going through and having a look and everyone’s different paper prototypes and pseudocode, once again you could really see the diverse range of directions people are starting to go in which was exciting. My paper prototype shows the basic concept of how the online visualizer I am working towards is going to function, starting with a landing page which then directs to an online environment where there is music and video playing accompanied by on screen visuals.

### Project Pseudo Code: 
```
IF “Enter Virtual Festival’ button is clicked THEN
show Visualiser
END IF
IF ‘See Tracklist’ button is clicked THEN
Show tracklist
END IF

VAR song
VAR Analyser
VAR Visualier Shape

FUNCTION preload Song = loadSound “ “

FUNCTION setup Analyser set input song
Video = createCapture(VIDEO) Detected Caputre = Plot points

FUNCTION draw
VAR volume = analyser getLevel
Volume level SETS Visualiser shape size

IF Motion Detected
THEN
Visualiser shape position = Plot point position ELSE
Visualiser Shape (mouseX, MouseY)

FUNCTION mouse click Visualiser Shape colour changes
IF pause button is clicked 
THEN song = stop
```

### p5.js Workshop: 

This week's class workshop was focused around speech recognition in through p5. Speech after Shuchen had been looking into this area. I was actually quite surprised at how well the speech recognition was functions, as well as how relatively simple it was to get going. This little workshop definitely got me on a bit of a conspiracy roller coaster after class thinking about the potentials of machine learning. None the less the workshop was great, and the more p5.js sketches I see the more ideas pop into my head, which is really helpful for my creative process.

### Further Research:
After the p5.speech sketch in class sparked my interest in the possibilities learning more about speech recognition and smart devices in particular I did some research just out of my own curiosity. Below is a link to a Ted Talk by Kashmir Hill and Surya Mattu which talks about what our smart devices know about us. It's very interesting and even a bit scary the amount of data smart devices is collecting on us through technology much like that which we looked into today.
