# Week 10 

### Project Progress: 
Since last week I have made some progress and also adjustments to my goals. I have now incorporated the [ml5 Posenet](https://ml5js.org/reference/api-PoseNet/ "ml5 Posenet") library for webcam facial recognition which is now playing a role in determining the movements of the visualiser, I have also began to add some interface and style elements to the sketch. Although I have made the decision to move away from working with 3D objects. I feel that I am not quite up the level where I could confidently incorporate all the interactive functions (such as the Posenet) as well as the 3D objects with in the time frame, and I have deemed the interactive elements more essential to the overall system, therefore I am going to focus on these elements in order to get the best proof of concept possible.

##### Posenet Example:
Example of how the the balls movement is working of the nose position based on webcam facial tracking via [ml5 Posenet](https://ml5js.org/reference/api-PoseNet/ "ml5 Posenet").

##### Project Next Steps:
* Work on interface.
* Add some variation to the movements of the visualiser.
* Work with adding some more interactive elements.
* Get pause/play button working.

### Expanded Field Research/Inspiration:

##### Artist of Interest:
[Mark J. Stock](http://markjstock.com/field "Mark J. Stock"), is an artist, scientist, and programmer who creates still and moving images and objects combining elements of nature, physics, chaos, computation, and algorithm. He describes his work as an exploration between the natural world and its simulated counterpart, between organic and inorganic, digital and analog, and structure and fluid. 

I first came across his piece 'Gyre 35700' while looking through some generative art examples on [AI Artists, Generative Art Guide](https://aiartists.org/generative-art-design "AI Artists, Generative Art Guide") and loved the aesthetic which provoked me to look into some of his other works. Exploring his website, I fell in love with the fluidity and organic nature of his generative, algorithmic pieces.

'Gyre 35700' 

'Streamline' By Mark J stock. 'A streamline is a static representation of a dynamic flow. Works in this series were created with an algorithm that was originally designed to study blood flow through artificial heart valves.'
