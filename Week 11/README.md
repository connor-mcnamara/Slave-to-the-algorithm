# Week 11

### Summary:
In this week's class we got the chance to have another feedback session with Karen and Andy, along with some discussion with other students in the class. As we're nearing the end of the class these feedback sessions are becoming more and more valuable as we begin to refine, polish and fix issues that have continued to hinder our progress. I found the feedback which I received very valuable, the comments and function, interface and code specific segments gave me a lot to work with and think about coming into our last week.
