# Week 12
Finished Project Link: [The Articulation Experience] (https://connor-mcnamara.github.io/Slave-to-the-algorithm/Articulation_/ "The Articulation Experience")


### Major changes from last week's feedback:

Last when I received some valuable feedback for Karen, Andy and other students in our class leading into our presentation I took all these things in to consideration and made some adjustments according. Notably, I loaded my own selected fonts in replacing the defaults, added and adjusted UI elements, made the background images more vibrant to reduce dullness, increased bubble size and also made the colour of the bubbles change automatically.
