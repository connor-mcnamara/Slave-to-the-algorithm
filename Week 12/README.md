# Week 12
**Finished Project Link:** [The Articulation Experience](https://connor-mcnamara.github.io/Slave-to-the-algorithm/Articulation_/ "The Articulation Experience")


### Major changes from last week's feedback:

Last when I received some valuable feedback for Karen, Andy and other students in our class leading into our presentation I took all these things in to consideration and made some adjustments according. Notably, I loaded my own selected fonts in replacing the defaults, added and adjusted UI elements, made the background images more vibrant to reduce dullness, increased bubble size and also made the colour of the bubbles change automatically.

## Reflective Statement:
Coming into this class I had very minimal experience with programming and coding, that in a sense was why I chose Slave to the Algorithm, to explore new potentials and challenge myself as a designer. To be honest, at times throughout this semester I definitely underestimated the difficulty and time involved with producing solutions with the coding environment. This did lead to circumstances where I had to evaluate with my skill level, whether or not the ideas in my head possible within the timeframe, often leading to me having to pivot my ideas accordingly.

Although in saying that, when I did spend the time indulging in learning and experimenting with code, it led to me becoming more and more interested in the exploring and understanding the possibilities of code. This studio has definitely opened my eyes to the potential code has to enhance design and open up new doors and opportunity, going forward with my practice I will definitely be more open-minded to going beyond the Adobe Suite to bring ideas to life.
