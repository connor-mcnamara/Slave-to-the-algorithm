# Week 7

### Summary and Project Update:
Unfortunately I missed this week session, So I missed the in class activities but I did go over the week 7 module on canvas and complete some of the tasks related to our projects as well as having a look and play with the sketch tutorials that where completed in the class. As far as my project is concerned, since last week I have decided to pivot my idea significantly. After doing some more research into the code, libraries and functions that would be needed to take tracked GPX data from an iPhone and use that to generate art, I came to the conclusion that it was going to be a bit outside my scope of ability. Therefore, I have decided to focus on the other element which I pitched, 'The Prism' a digital visualiser. I am also going to be taking on the advice of Michael Lam about potentially making this speculative festival a virtual festival.

#### Revised Proposal: 
‘Articulation’ a virtual, interactive music and visualisation environment.

#### Revised Plan: 
Create an online portal to a virtual festival where people can enter and listen to DJ sets which are accompanied by a digital visualiser that changes according to the music playing, mouse movements, key presses and wemcam or camera motion.
