# Week 7

### Summary and Project Update:
Unfortunately I missed this week session, So I missed the in class activities but I did go over the week 7 module on canvas and complete some of the tasks related to our projects as well as having a look and play with the sketch tuturoials that where completed in the class. As far as my project is cocnerned,  since last week I have deciced to pivot my idea singnificantly. After doing some more research into the code, libaries and functions that would be needed to take tracked GPX data from an iPhone and use that to generate art, I came to the conclusion that it was going to be a bit outside my scope of ability. Therefore I have deciced to focus on the other element which I pitched, 'The Prism' a digital visualiser. I am also goign to be taking on the advice of Michael Lam about potentially making this specualtive festival a virtual festival. 

#### Revised Proposal: 
‘Articulation’ a virtual, interactive music and visualisation environment.

### Post pitch presentation project pivot précis:
